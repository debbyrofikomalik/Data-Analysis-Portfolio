## About This Portfolio

This repository highlights my expertise in data analytics, showcasing my ability to clean, process, and analyze complex datasets using a wide range of tools and techniques. The projects cover the full data analytics workflow, from data extraction and preprocessing to exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization. Each project demonstrates my ability to uncover meaningful patterns, generate actionable insights, and communicate findings effectively through interactive dashboards and clear reporting.  

Through these projects, I have applied skills in SQL for data management, Python for data analysis and visualization, and Power BI/Looker Studio for reporting, reflecting my ability to transform raw data into interpretable insights across diverse contexts.

## Project 1: [Hotel Booking Analysis](https://github.com/debbyrofikomalik/hotel-booking-analysis)

This project examines hotel booking patterns from both City and Resort Hotels to identify factors contributing to high cancellation rates and propose actionable strategies to reduce them. Using Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, the project investigates how booking price, customer behavior, and market segments influence cancellations. The analysis reveals that higher average daily rates and longer waiting lists are strongly linked to increased cancellations, while most bookings originate from online travel agencies. Recommendations include adjusting pricing strategies during high-cancellation periods, offering promotional discounts, and improving service quality in key regions to minimize cancellations and optimize hotel revenue.

## Project 2: [Vendor Performance Analysis](https://github.com/debbyrofikomalik/vendor-performance-analysis)

This project analyzes vendor performance by integrating sales, purchase, and inventory data to generate actionable insights for pricing, inventory turnover, and supplier efficiency. Using SQL for data integration, Python for in-depth analysis, and Power BI for interactive dashboards, the project highlights high-margin opportunities, inventory inefficiencies, and vendor concentration risks, providing a clear framework for data-driven decision-making.

## [Project 3: Credit Card Dashboard](https://github.com/debbyrofikomalik/Credit-Card-Dashboard)

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior, revenue generation, and credit risk for a U.S.-based credit card company. Using **Google Looker Studio** for interactive visualization and **Google Sheets** for data preparation, the dashboard highlights customer demographics, spending patterns, and delinquency trends derived from a private dataset obtained through the **MySkill Data Science & Analysis training program**.  

The analysis identifies key insights, including regional concentration in California, Texas, and New York, dominant segments among self-employed and graduate customers, and varying risk profiles across occupations and education levels. It reveals that businessmen and self-employed customers contribute the highest revenue, while government employees without formal education show higher delinquency risks. Recommendations focus on optimizing rewards programs, improving credit monitoring systems, and tailoring marketing campaigns based on customer demographics and spending behavior to enhance profitability and minimize financial risk.
