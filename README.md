## üìà Featured Project

### üè® [Hotel Booking Analysis Project](https://github.com/debbyrofikomalik/Hotel-Booking-Analysis)

In this project, I analyzed and visualized **hotel booking data** from both a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel to understand the key factors behind high cancellation rates.  
The goal was to identify **patterns, correlations, and business insights** to help hotels **minimize cancellations** and **increase revenue efficiency**.  

The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore relationships between price, seasonality, and cancellations  
- Recommendations on **dynamic pricing**, **targeted marketing**, and **seasonal discounting** strategies  

üìò *Main tools used:* Python (Google Colab)
üìä *Dataset source:* [Hotel Booking Demand Dataset ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking/data)
üñ•Ô∏è *Deck presentation:* [View on Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG18jImy_8/0aAcw-tLTv688iU09dQ0Kw/edit)
