## Project 2: [Vendor Performance Analysis](https://github.com/debbyrofikomalik/vendor-performance-analysis)

This project analyzes vendor performance by combining sales, purchase, and inventory data to generate actionable insights for optimizing pricing, improving inventory turnover, and enhancing supplier efficiency. Using SQL for data integration, Python for in-depth analysis, and Power BI for interactive dashboards, the project identifies high-margin opportunities, inventory inefficiencies, and vendor concentration risks, providing a clear framework for data-driven decision-making.
